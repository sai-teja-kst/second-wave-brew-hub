            The second wave of coffee represents a pivotal moment when coffee transformed 
            from a commodity to a craft. It's about understanding the origin, the process, 
            and the artistry behind every cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Second Wave, we honor this tradition by sourcing premium beans directly 
            from sustainable farms, roasting them to perfection, and crafting each drink 
            with precision and passion. Every cup tells a story of the hands that grew, 
            processed, and prepared it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-coffee-primary font-semibold">
            We believe great coffee brings people together, creates moments of connection, 
            and elevates the everyday into something extraordinary.
